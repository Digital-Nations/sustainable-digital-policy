# Artificial intelligence (AI) models and tools
## Sustainability Considerations
- Governments and organizations are increasingly using custom AI and 3rd party generative AI programs (such as ChatGPT) to automate operations however, AI can be a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.
- The highest source of greenhouse gas emissions from AI is at the data centre level. Running the servers that AI requires to store the vast data required for AI results in substantial energy consumption. "the carbon footprint of training one large ML model, such as Meena (Patterson et al., 2021), is equivalent to 242,231 miles driven by an average passenger vehicle (EPA, 2021)"
- The embodied carbon of the servers used by the AI system is also significant and depending on the 'greenness' of the energy of the grid where the servers are running, this embodied carbon (from manufacture, transportation, disposal) can actually be exponentially higher than the GHGs resulting from the use of the servers.
- Governments are in a unique position to use buying power to push the 3rd party AI industry towards more responsible AI development and use

## Policy measures/Practices

### Procure AI 3rd part tools that meet sustainability standards
- vendor has set greenhouse-gas reduction targets
- vendor's tools operate on zero-emission data centre facilities

  ### Require the completion of an environmental impact assessments for IT projects using AI
- ensure that any decision to develop, procure or use AI is informed by the results of the environmental impact assessment

## What Digital Nations are doing
### Canada
- Canada included sustainability considerations in their 2023 [Guide on Use of Generative AI](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html)
