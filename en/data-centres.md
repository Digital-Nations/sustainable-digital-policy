# Data centres
## Sustainability Considerations
- Digitalisation of services results in increased needs for compute and storage driving a rapid increase in data centre energy requirements and water use.
- According to the US government "Data centers are one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building."

## Policy measures/practices

### Set sutainability requirements for your data centres
Some requirements to consider are:
- using 100% renewable or low carbon energy, and using a local energy source
- ensuring that data centres are strategically located (away from areas of water stress, where temperatures allow for air cooling etc.) 
- having a water management plan in place
- ensuring that data centre equipment meets ecolabel requirements.

### Comply with standards and regulations
There are many interenational standards and regulations for data centres. Some are just related to the building envelope and others consider the entirety of data centre operations. Some standards and regulations to consider include:
- [EU Code of Conduct for energy efficient data centres](https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/communities/data-centres-code-conduct)
- [LEED](https://www.usgbc.org/leed) / [BREEAM](https://bregroup.com/products/breeam/)
- ISO 14000 and 14040
- [Optimizing Server Refresh Cycles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8263130)

### Ensure your contracts for procured data centre services (Cloud, Colocation data centres) include sustainability and reporting requirements
- [Green Public Procurement (GPP) Criteria for Data Centres, Server Rooms and Cloud Services](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC118558)
- Ensure the hosting provider does not overprovision - that the service meets current needs but can be scaled up/down as required

## Cloud services
## Sustainability Considerations
Moving to cloud can generate sustainability savings but there are caveats:
- Generally cloud services run at better efficiency rates than on-premise data centres. This can mean that for your workload, less IT equipment could be required and therefore less energy will be required to run the workload.
- However, it is important to consider the energy mix for the grid in your area when estimating the emissions savings from these efficiencies. 
Large savings can be generated if the energy mix in your area is high carbon.
But, if the energy mix in your area is already all or mostly renewable, the emissions savings from Cloud efficiencies could be negligible.
- In order to determine if moving to the Cloud will generate sustainability savings, you need to measure or estimate the current energy use, waste and emissions for that workload in your on-premise data centre. 
- GHG emissions from purchased cloud services are indirect and are reported under scope 3. It is important to ensure that your organization is reporting on scope 3 emissions so as to not be  
- Cloud companies using renewable energy they are generating themselves
- waste heat reuse
- water use

Many of the major Cloud companies provide emissions information to customers:
- Google provides their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
- Microsoft provides their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
- Amazon Web Services provides their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 will be available to customers in early 2024.


## Policy measures/Practices

### Set procurement standards for Cloud services regarding sustainability
- Some measures to consider:
  - Cloud provider has set greenhouse-gas reduction targets
  - Cloud provider operate on zero-emission data centre facilities

  
### Require your Cloud services providers to report annually on your emissions from their services

### Canada
Canada commissioned a set of [Green Procurement Criteria for cloud services](https://www.ecpar.org/sites/ecpar.org/files/documents/gpp_criteria_cloud_services_def_en_2022_1.pdf) that was vetted by the buying group Buyers for Climate Action.
