# Data centres (also see [Cloud Services](cloud-services.md))
## Sustainability Considerations
- Digitalisation of services results in increased needs for compute and storage driving a rapid increase in data centres and their energy requirements and water use.
- According to the [US government](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/data-centers-and-servers) "Data centers are one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building."
- When it comes to data centre sustainability, it is important to look beyond the direct emissions from data centres and also consider the emissions that were created when data centre equipment was manufactured and transported to the data centre (scope 3 emissions).

## Policy measures/practices

### Set sutainability requirements for your data centres
Some requirements to consider are:
- using 100% renewable or low carbon energy, and using a local energy source
- ensuring that data centres are strategically located (away from areas of water stress, where temperatures allow for air cooling etc.) 
- having a water management plan in place
- ensuring that data centre equipment meets ecolabel requirements.

### Comply with standards and regulations
There are many interenational standards and regulations for data centres. Some are just related to the building envelope and others consider the entirety of data centre operations. Some standards and regulations to consider include:
- [EU Code of Conduct for energy efficient data centres](https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/communities/data-centres-code-conduct)
- [LEED](https://www.usgbc.org/leed) / [BREEAM](https://bregroup.com/products/breeam/)
- ISO 14000 and 14040
- [Optimizing Server Refresh Cycles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8263130)

### Ensure your contracts for procured data centre services (Cloud, Colocation data centres) include sustainability requirements
- Ensure that your hosting provider has set greenhouse gas reduction targets (including for scope 3) and is moving towards net zero by 2050 or sooner.
- Ensure that your hosting provider submits regular reports including data on the energy, water consumption and CO2e emissions (including scope 3) resulting from the contract
- Ensure that your hosting provider has circular ICT policies and strategies in place to support the reuse, refurbishment and repair of equipment supporting the hosting services.
- Ensure the hosting provider does not overprovision - that the service meets current needs but can be scaled up/down as required
  
## What Digital Nations are doing
## UK
The UK has developed a sustainable procurement guide for ICT that includes recommendations for sustainable data centres
