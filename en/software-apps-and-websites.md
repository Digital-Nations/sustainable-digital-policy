## Sustainability Considerations
- software on its own does not create emissions, however the development of software and the running of software as a service (in [..data centres] and from the IT hardware it runs on) can produce significant emissions.
- It is possible to design software and websites so that the running of that software requires less energy, equipment and ultimately fewer emissions

## Policy measures/Practices

### Use reen software design
Software suppliers should demonstrate how energy efficiency, hardware efficiency and carbon awareness are integrated and considered during the design process. 

For software and websites built in house, these elements should also be considered as part of the design process and part of either the Authority to Operate or continuous improvement process.

### Use good strong data management practices
For both purchased software as well as software and websites built in-house, strong data management practices should be followed to reduce the generation and/or storage of unnecessary and/or duplicated data.

### Track and report on the emissions created by websites and software
Require software suppliers to report on a regular basis on the improvements they are making around carbon reduction, and data efficiencies.

For all software and websites (both purchased and built), track emissions created.

For websites, use tools like the below to measure emissions and get suggestions for changes to make that would reduce the emissions of your websites:
